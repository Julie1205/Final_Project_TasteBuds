# Final_Project_TasteBuds

## What TasteBuds is:
TasteBuds is a full-stack web application where users can save restaurants they have been to or want to go to.

This application requires that users be logged in to use any of the features. Log in authentication and password encryption is handled by Auth0. 

Once logged in, users can search for restaurants based on location or name and save them. Restaurants can be saved with the following tags: been to, wish to go to, liked, disliked, favorite. Additionally, users can also add cuisine type, comments and pictures to their saved restaurants. 

Saved restaurants can be found in their respective categories and searched for based on name or using map view. All saved restaurants entries can be edited and deleted. 

TasteBuds is also built with responsive design.
